# Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing global COVID-19 data using SQL. It utilizes two key datasets — CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations — to uncover trends in infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.
The analysis is performed using SQL queries aimed at answering real-world questions about the pandemic's impact. The final result offers insights that could support public health decision-making and awareness.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- SQL Server (or compatible relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Public COVID-19 Datasets from Our World in Data
- Optional: Power BI, Tableau, or Python for visualization (not included here)

## Datasets Used
- CovidDeaths
- CovidVaccinations

## Key Analysis Topics
- Trends in total cases and deaths across countries
- Death percentages relative to reported cases
- Infection rates by population
- Countries with the highest impact (deaths, cases, infection percentage)
- Vaccination progress and its correlation to population
- Analysis at continent level and global level

# SQL Concepts Applied
- Joins between multiple tables
- Window functions for cumulative metrics
- Aggregations and grouping
- Filtering and data cleaning
- Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary tables for modular analysis

## How to Run the Project
- Import CovidDeaths.csv and CovidVaccinations.csv into your SQL database.
- Open and run the SQL script (queries.sql) sequentially.
- Optional: Connect to a BI tool (like Power BI) for visualization.
